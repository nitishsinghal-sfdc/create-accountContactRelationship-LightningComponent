# create-accountContactRelationship-LightningComponent
Lightning Component to search email, if existing contact found, use it, other let create new contact and associate with existing accounts (Creating Account Contact Releationship Records) using multi select picklist (for Roles) in table view. Thanks to Manish Choudhari, I have used his Multi Select Picklist code and modified very little according to my needs.
